"""
Problem -
The area of a circle is πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. 
(The raised 2 in the formula is an exponent.) Write a Python statement that calculates 
and prints the area in square inches of a circle whose radius is 8 inches. 
Assume that the constant π=3.14.
"""

"""
Solution - Compute the area of a circle, given the length of its radius
