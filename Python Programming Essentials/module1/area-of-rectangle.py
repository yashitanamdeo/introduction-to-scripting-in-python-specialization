Problem - The area of a rectangle is wh, where w and h are the lengths of its sides. 
Note that the multiplication operation is not shown explicitly in this formula. 
This is standard practice in mathematics, but not in programming. 
Write a Python statement that calculates and prints the area in square inches of 
a rectangle with sides of length 4 and 7 inches.
"""

"""
Solution - Compute the area of a rectangle, given its width and height.
